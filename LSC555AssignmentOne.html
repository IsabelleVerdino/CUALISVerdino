<h1> Assignment One: System Evauluation </h1>  

	<h2> System Introduction </h2> 

		<h3> Context </h3>

			<p> The International Children’s Digital Library is an online library 				database created by a team at the University of Maryland’s Computer 				Science Department. They collaborated with UMD’s Human-Computer 				Interaction Lab. It was supported by UMD's iSchool and Computer Science 			Department. Most of the launch was spearheaded by Dr. Allison Druin.</p> 

			<p> Their mission is to “support the world's children in becoming 				effective members of the global community - who exhibit tolerance and 				respect for diverse cultures, languages and ideas -- by making the best 			in children's literature available online free of charge.” They launched 			in 2002 and made books available online at a time when no one else was 				seeking to do so. Cutting edge at the time, their content remains 				relevant while their interface has aged. </p> 

			<p> Additionally, as of April 2021, one of the developers posted that 				after many years of serving this cause without any funding, the website 			would be shutting down in its entirety. That lasted less than a month 				before UMD’s Computer Science Department agreed to host a static version 			of the International Children’s Digital Library. The revived the website 			in a simplified form. All of the books are back and downloadable in 				their original language. </p> 

			<p> To preface the rest of this assessment, it is hard to fully assess 				the database for quality and usability because it is not running at the 			level it once did. There are no active or responsive elements still 				running. At this point, the collection is essentially archived. However, 			they are still the largest collection of freely available complete 				children’s books from around the world. There is value in reviving this 			database, so I will make my observations under the assumption that it 				may one day be reworked and revived.</p> 
		
		<h3> Users </h3>
			
			<p> This system is designed for use by children, their parents, and 				instructors designing content or curriculum for children. So the users 				are children or anyone wanting to access complete children’s books 				online. The stakeholders for this website are librarians, publishers, 				authors of the included books, The University of Maryland's Human-				Computer Interaction Lab, and the users themselves. </p> 

		<h3> Content </h3>

			<p> This digital library includes 4,469 Children’s Books in 59 different 			languages. There is no search function for these books by title, but you 			can scroll through the list of all of the books in alphabetical order by 			language. As the website is a full digital library, they have 					categorized them by a selection of tags. A user can filter the books 				into these categories: 

			<ul> 
				<li> Books by Language </li> 
				<li> Books by Color </li> 
				<li> Books by Shape </li> 
				<li> Books by Format </li> 
				<li> Books by Genre </li> 
				<li> Books by Character </li> 
				<li> Books by True vs. Make Believe </li> 
			</ul> 

			<p> Once you choose a book and open it up with ICDL’s Digital Reader, a 			thumbnail of the book’s cover is displayed along with the title, author 			and translator information, publishing data, ISBN number, contributor of 			the book, and an “abstract”, or, brief summary of the book. There is 				also a statement of fair use and distribution notice. </p> 

			<p> By clicking on “Read with ICDL Reader” you are directed to a new 				page with the thumbnail images of the entire book. The user is able to 				click on one of the page images to jump to that page. Or, you can start 			at the beginning and click through pages one at a time. </p> 


	<h2> Discussion </h2> 

		<h3> Interesting Features </h3>
			
			<p> The most interesting factor of this digital library is that it is 				free to use and contains the entire text of thousands of children’s 				books. The content is high quality and reliable. All of the books are 				uploaded as high-definition images. The books are presented in their 				entirety. Technically, the website is incredibly responsive and fast. 				There are no loading screens or problems with any of the hundreds of 				links on the page.</p> 

			<p> The International Children’s Digital Library tagging system is 				impressive. There is so much data available. It is not the most advanced 			or responsive design in its current form, but they have run four 				thousand books through a sorting system and grouped them together in 				numerous different ways. Their tags include all of the basic information 			you would collect about books when digitizing them in their entirety. 				And no matter where on the globe you are, if you have internet access, 				you also have thousands of books to read.</p> 

		<h3> Pros and Cons </h3> 
			<p> There are a lot of pros to the ICDL! Beyond the content and the 				technological aspects, there are a lot of factors that focus on 				preserving the content and prioritizing the users. One of the pros of 				the Home Screen is the forum where the people who run the website are 				able to speak directly to the users. I think it’s transparent and builds 			user trust to see announcements directly from the developers. That’s how 			I learned most of background on this website and its most recent 				updates. </p>

			<p> One of the cons is the interface itself. Colors are good! For a 				Children’s library, colors are important. However, the color scheme of 				the homepage is discordant. Primarily red and green with some other 				accents thrown in. It’s not particularly visually appealing.</p> 


		<h3> Suggestions for Improvement </h3>

			<p> Aesthetically, the website could be improved. It seems that they 				tried to use bright colors and limited text to appeal to children, who 				are primarily the users of this platform. However, I think adding some 				pictures with headings would be a better way to hyperlink to other 				pages– that way there is a visual indicator of where each link leads. 				The thumbnail previews of the book pages are impactful, they should 				expand this design strategy to other facets of the website.  </p> 

			<p> Right now there is no responsive styling. The content is not sized 				to fit the screen on either the home page or the pages of the books 				themselves. The Home Page is too narrow and does not fit the standard 				computer screen size. The reader view of the books is too zoomed in: you 			cannot read the entire page without scrolling.</p> 

			<p> The sorting system already has a lot of information, but I think its 			navigability could be improved. The books are already sorted into all of 			these categories, but the website should allow the use of multiple 				filters at one time. For example, if you start with the full list of 				titles but only want to look at books in Mandarin, you should be able to 			select Mandarin and then further narrow down your choices by genre or 				format. Right now, you can only choose one limiter at a time.</p> 

			<p> Lastly, to keep this platform engaging as we enter Web 2.0, it would 			be important to integrate the user more into the website. I don’t 				believe that the books need a commenting feature because then you would 			need staff or software to read and moderate comments for inappropriate 				content. However, a rating system or voting system to show which books 				are the most popular would be a good system to implement. That way your 			experience improves the more other users interact with it.</p>
